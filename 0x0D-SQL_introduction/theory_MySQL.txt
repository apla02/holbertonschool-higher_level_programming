What’s a database
A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data,
typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually
controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS,
along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database
system, often shortened to just database.

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows
 and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient.
The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized.


DBMS
A database typically requires a comprehensive database software program known as a database 
management system (DBMS). A DBMS serves as an interface between the database and its end users
 or programs, allowing users to retrieve, update, and manage how the information is organized 
and optimized. A DBMS also facilitates oversight and control of databases, enabling a variety 
of administrative operations such as performance monitoring, tuning, and backup and recovery.

Some examples of popular database software or DBMSs include MySQL, Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server,
FileMaker Pro, Oracle Database, and dBASE.

Types of DBMS:
*heriarchycal
*network
*relational
*object oriented

Relational database
The relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are
 separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators 
 can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure. 
 For example, renaming a database file does not rename the tables stored within it.

 DDL(data definition language)
 DDL statements are used to build and modify the structure of your tables and other objects in the 
 database. When you execute a DDL statement, it takes effect immediately.
 instructions are CREATE, ALTER y DROP

 DML(Data manipulation language)
 DML statements are used to work with the data in tables. When you are connected to most multi-user 
 databases (whether in a client program or by a connection from a Web page script)
 instructions are SHOW, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE y DELETE
